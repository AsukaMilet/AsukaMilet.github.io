Hi! I'm AsukaMilet. 

Currently delving into databases and distributed systems. I'm also interested in machine learning but don't have the time to work on them at the moment. I'm fascinated by how systems can contribute to this field in future research.

Outside of work, I'm a fan of J-POP, from which my name AsukaMilet comes.
